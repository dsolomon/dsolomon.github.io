* dynamically typed - no type checking prior to running unlike C++, Java and Swift.
* uses duck typing.
* general purpose programming language not designed for anything specific
* it's an interpreted language.
* uses white space to deliminate code blocks.
* different types pypy, jython, IronPython, cPython.
* python 3 is the definite future and use it when possible.


##Comments
* single line comments start w/ a "#" and go to the end of the line
* use triple quotes for multi-line comments

##Types in Python
* No longs, doubles, unsigned/signed integers, shorts.

* Not as many types as other languages.
* Can lead to type errors.
* Can use Type hinting to overcome but better to use Unit Tests.
