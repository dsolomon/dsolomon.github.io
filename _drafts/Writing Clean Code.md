#Writing Clean Code

##Naming
- goal is to make code as easy as possible to understand
- choosing good names takes time but saves time
- change names when you find better ones
- no puns/jokes
- use pronounceable & searchable names
- single letter names only for local variables in short methods
- length of the name corresponds with it's scope
- class and objects should be nouns or noun phrase
- methods should be verb or verb phrase
- one word per concept (fetch, retrieve, get) are all the same concept
- when constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods w/ names that describe arguments
- Names of variables, functions, and classes should:
1. why it exists
2. what it does
3. how it is used

##StyleGuides
- take a look at camelcase and snakecase
