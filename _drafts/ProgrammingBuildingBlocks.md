#Programming Building Blocks

##Variables


##Functions
* functions are just a set of steps.
* functions should do 1 thing


##For Loops
* run code for a fixed amount of time.


##While Loops
* run until a condition changes.

##Objects
*
* What Is an Object? (The Java™ Tutorials > Learning the Java Language > Object-Oriented Programming Concepts)
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html


##Methods
* A function with a different name
* A behavior.


##Constructors
* A special method.
* It's like any function.


##Classes
* A logical group of functions and data.
* Everything mentioned can relate to one word.
* Help you write more readable and maintainable code.
* Can force behavior.
* Can create separate instances of each class.

##Packages
* Place related classes and interfaces into packages.
* Like putting all similar files into one folder.

##Common Programming Tasks
* passing the result of one function to another.
* calling one function from another
