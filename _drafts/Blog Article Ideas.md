Do not be afraid. 

Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long.

This also implies that functions should not be large enough to hold nested structures.
Therefore, the indent level of a function should not be greater than one or two.

Functions should do one thing, do it well and do it only. 
- one level of abstraction.
