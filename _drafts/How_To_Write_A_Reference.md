# How to write a great reference.

### 1. Get Personal.

A great reference comes from an emotional place. If you don't feel an emotional connection with your referal your reference will fall flat and appear forced. It's
not uncommon that a great employee came through for you in a difficult situation that's the mindset you need when beginning your reference.

### 2. The Intro: Context Awareness

Establish context, what was your role in relation to the reference and what motivated you to endorse them. A reference serves the next hiring team and management.
Therefore it's important that the reference motivates the next team to choose your reference over the competition.

### 3. The Middle: Tell a Story with Data

The manager and the team have to be able to imagine enjoying working with your reference. Highlight performance with quantitative data.

The most important part of the story being told in a reference is the quantitative facts that prove your referrals worth. The closer this is tied to money saved/generated for the business the better.

### 5. The Conclusion: Future Focused

Wrap up your reference with 1 sentence that succinctly summarizes the candidate and the story with a glowing endorsement.
