Getting Started with Github Part 2

Creating a New Branch

- Why would you need a new branch? 



If a merge conflict doesn't make sense - look at master and see what they committed. 

Work Flow Day in Day out

1. Feature Request
2. Make a Branch for it
3. Code in your Request
4. Commit it
5. Merge Master back into it
6. Push that up and make a Pull request.
